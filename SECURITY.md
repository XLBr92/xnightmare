Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a security vulnerability, please contact the maintainers directly or open an issue with the security label. We take security concerns seriously and will respond as quickly as possible.

Image Protection Policy
To protect the intellectual property and digital artwork hosted on this site, we employ multiple technical and legal measures to discourage unauthorized usage:

✔️ Technical Deterrents
Right-click on images is disabled.
Image dragging and selection are blocked.
Pointer events on images are turned off to prevent interaction.
Optional watermarking for attribution and tracking.
Although these measures don't offer absolute protection (e.g., screenshots cannot be prevented), they significantly reduce casual theft.
